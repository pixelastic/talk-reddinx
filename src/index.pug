      p I also love to gather a bunch of friends, sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons
      p As the gamemaster, I like to create stories to engage my players
      p Have them in fantastic locations, like in a flying city, in the heart of a volcano or a haunted manor
      p Great way to spark the imagination is to have a map to share

    //- p But they have an API
    //- p Great because self-explanatory, no auth, lots of data
    //- p Bad because same, can't go to far in the past
    //- p Have personal API as well for finding old elements

    p Crappy Search
    p Availabe API
    p Algolia
    p Recipe for side project

  +slide
    p /maps
    p Demo
    p Infinite scroll, sorted by popularity, newest first

  +slide
    p Getting the data
    p Find subreddit creation date
    p target API and ask for all posts in batch, month after month
    p Pushshift
    p {Screenshot of the folders, with each month}
    p {Screenshot of the final looking Algolia record}

  +slide
    p Automatic updates
    p Script on Circle CI, runs every day
    p Picks the latest posts and update the data
    p Adds new one and updates popularity of old ones
    p (yes, there is a window where popularity is off if an old one is upvoted)

  +slide
    p Front end is one HTML page
    p The full Pinterest time-sucking experience
    p Algolia for Infinite Hits
    p CSS Grid for the masonry effect (code example of JS/CSS?)

  +slide
    p Project is open source
    p Website, with all the data, and if you want to build a similar UI
    p Reddinx if you want to index another of your favorite subreddits
    p Works best if images, but I'm taking PRs to make it work with more text

  +slide
    p Remember, there is tons of data out there
    p Algolia is a great way to make it easier to navigate and open to more people
    p Pick a dataset, dump it into Algolia
    p Everything is better with Search

  +slide
    p Thanks!
